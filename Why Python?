1- Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. 2- Python’s syntax will also help you write “clean” code. Your code will be easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages.
3- People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web applications, solve business problems, and develop internal tools at all kinds of interesting companies.
4- Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work.
5-  Python community, which includes an incredibly diverse and welcoming group of people. Community is essential to programmers because programming isn’t a solitary pursuit. Most of us, even the most experienced programmers, need to ask advice from others who have already solved similar problems. Having a well-connected and supportive community is critical in helping you solve problems, and the Python community is fully supportive of people like you who are learning Python as your first programming language.

Python is a great language to learn! :)
